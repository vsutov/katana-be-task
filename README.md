Dockerized REST API simulation of a card deck

## Important notes
- Deck is generated in accordance with [this information](https://ambitiouswithcards.com/new-deck-order/)
- Drawing happens from a deck that has it's cards shirts facing up. First card to draw from an unshuffled full deck would always be an Ace of Hearts
- Author assumes that drawing the last card from the deck renders it unusable, therefore deletion of the deck is to happen
- A potential (intentional?) typo has been made in the assignment: short deck of cards consists of 36 cards, meaning that cards from 2 to 5 should be excluded, not 2 to 6. Solution provided in accordance to AC yet it is still worth mentioned
